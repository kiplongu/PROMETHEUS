# Let's install the Node Exporter.

In a new terminal, change to your home directory and download Node Exporter version 1.1.2 for Linux:

# wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.1.2/node_exporter-1.1.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz

Extract the archive:

# tar xvfz node_exporter-1.1.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz

Change into the extracted directory:

# cd node_exporter-1.1.2.linux-amd64

# The Node Exporter has a variety of collector modules that can be configured or turned off and on via
# flags (see the Node Exporter's collector module documentation). However, by default it will start up
# with a reasonable configuration without providing any flags.
Start the Node Exporter:
# ./node_exporter
