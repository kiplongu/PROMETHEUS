# query Prometheus:

# Click on Add your first data source in the Home view that is shown after logging in.
# Choose “Prometheus” as a datasource type.
# Fill out the data source fields:
# ○ Enter Demo Prometheus into the Name field.
# ○ Set the URL to http://<machine-ip>:9090.
# ○ Leave the other fields at their defaults.
# Click Save & test and verify that the data source was saved and tested successfully.
