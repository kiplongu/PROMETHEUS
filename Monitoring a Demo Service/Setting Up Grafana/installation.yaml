# Grafana can be deployed and configured in multiple ways, and can use different backends for storing
# dashboard metadata. We will not discuss operational details of Grafana here, but you can find these in
# the Grafana documentation. To keep things simple, you are going to run Grafana on Docker with
# default configuration parameters.

To run Grafana on Docker on port 3000, run:


 docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name grafana grafana/grafana:7.5.4
