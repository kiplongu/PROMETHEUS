Run three instances of the demo service in the background, each on its own port:
./prometheus_demo_service -listen-address=:10000 &
./prometheus_demo_service -listen-address=:10001 &
./prometheus_demo_service -listen-address=:10002 &


Each of the instances now serves synthetic metrics about itself on
http://<machine-ip>:<instance-port>/metrics. Explore the metrics of one instance a bit.
The demo service generates four different types of simulated metrics:
Metrics about an HTTP API server (request counts, durations, errors)
CPU usage metrics
Disk usage and total size metrics
Metrics about a batch job that runs periodically and can fail with a certain probability.
You will learn more about these metrics in detail when querying them.
