# Now we can create our first Grafana dashboard:

# Click on the + (Create) icon in the left menu, which takes you to an empty new dashboard.
# Click on Add an empty panel to add a new graph panel to the dashboard.
# Set the time range (at the top right of the graph panel) to Last 1 hour.
# Enter the following expression into the query expression field (with the placeholder text “Enter a
# PromQL query”):

sum without(instance, status)
 (rate(demo_api_request_duration_seconds_count{job="demo"}[1m]))

# This graphs the demo service HTTP request rate, aggregated over all instances and response
# status codes.
# Set the Legend field to {{path}}: {{method}} to display briefer legend strings that only contain the
# label values that are actually relevant to the displayed result.
# In the panel settings on the right, set the Panel Title field to Requests [rate-1m].
# Click Save at the top to save the dashboard under the name Demo Service.
