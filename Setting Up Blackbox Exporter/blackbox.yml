# This configures the Blackbox Exporter to allow probing targets over HTTP. The module name
# (http_2xx) can be freely chosen, but needs to match the value that Prometheus sends in the
# module HTTP parameter during a scrape to the Blackbox Exporter. This is how Prometheus chooses
# which type of probe to run through the exporter.

modules:
  http_2xx:
    prober: http
    timeout: 2s
    http:
      method: GET
      preferred_ip_protocol: "ip4"
